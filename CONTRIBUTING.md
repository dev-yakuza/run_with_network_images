## Develop

The main code is `lib/src/run_with_network_images.dart`. So, if you have any good idea or code, please modify it.

The `lib/src/run_with_network_images.mocks.dart` file is automatically generated by the `mockito` and `build_runner`.

So, if you want to update the version of the `build_runner` or `mockito` package, please run the following command to rebuild the mock file.

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

The `test/run_with_network_images_test.dart` file is the test file of the package. So, if you have any changes of the code, please add the test code about it in here.
